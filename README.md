# Project Setup and Installation

This project uses a `requirements.txt` file to list all the Python packages (and their specific versions) that the project depends on. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and install the required dependencies.

## Step 1: Open a Terminal or Command Prompt

Navigate to your project directory containing the `requirements.txt` file.

## Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is a good practice to create a virtual environment so that the packages you install do not interfere with system-wide packages.

### Creating a Virtual Environment

Run the following command to create a virtual environment (using `venv`):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies Using pip

With your virtual environment activated (or in your global environment), run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command tells pip to read the `requirements.txt` file and install all the listed packages.

## Step 4: Verify Installation

To verify that a package is installed correctly, you can run:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
```

This should print the installed version of PyTorch.

## Using an IDE

If you're using an IDE such as VS Code, you can use its integrated terminal to run these commands.

```
use python main.py to run all the models.
You can also specify the model which you want the results for by writing python main.py model_type (example: sagnn+cs or sagn or sun or esan or gnn).

```
